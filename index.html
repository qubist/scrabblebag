        <p><strong>Playing physical Scrabble remotely is hard</strong> because Scrabble is not a
        game of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information">perfect
        information</a>. This means each player in a game of Scrabble knows
        different things about the state of the game.</p>

        <p>Chess has perfect information so it's easy to synchronize your board
        with a far-off friend's. People have been doing so using the postal
        service <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess#Postal_(traditional_mail)_correspondence_chess">since
        the 1800s</a> and calling it "correspondence chess".</p>

        <p>With Scrabble, players don't know the tiles in their opponent's
        hands, and none of the players knows the contents of the tile bag. <strong>To
        play Scrabble remotely on two physical boards, we need a tool to keep
        track of a shared tile bag that both players can draw from.
        Scrabblebag.org does exactly this!</strong></p>

        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>Start a new game with 2–4 players. Copy your game's link and share it
        with your friends. Scrabblebag shows everyone the same thing: A page
        with each player's name and the shared tile bag in the middle.  Click on
        a player's name to view their hand.</p>

        <h3>Trust</h3> 
        <p>Just like during an in-person Scrabble game, with Scrabblebag it's
        the responsibility of the players not to peek at each other's hands or
        look into the bag. This means that you don't need to log in or create an
        account to use Scrabblebag.</p>

        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <p>Draw tiles, then select tiles from your hand to play them or put them
        back in the bag. You can change your name to remember whose hand belongs
        to who. Each game has a 9-letter game ID shown in the page's URL. With
        this code you can leave the page and return to the same game later.
        Games are saved until they have no activity for 30 days.</p>

        <h3>Using with your physical rack and board</h3>
        <p>Part of the joy of Scrabble is that tactile feel of the physical
        board and rack. We find that using Scrabble's physical tiles on a rack
        helped us experiment with words. Here's how to use Scrabblebag and your
        physical Scrabble in harmony:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Playing a word:</strong> I play onto my physical board
            from my tile rack.  Then I then select and play those tiles on the
            site as well.</li>
            <li><strong>An opponent plays a word:</strong> It's my job to
            replicate their play on my physical board by picking the right tiles
            from the bag.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> I click draw on the site and then pick
            out the corresponding physical tiles to add to my physical
            rack.</li>
          <ul>
        </p>
